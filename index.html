                        <h2>Vincent Willem van Gogh</h2>
                        <p>
                            Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist
                            painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.
                            In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil
                            paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. His oeuvre includes landscapes,
                            still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, most of which are characterised by bold colours
                            and dramatic brushwork that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art. Van
                            Gogh's
                            work was only beginning to gain critical attention before he died from a self-inflicted
                            gunshot at age 37. During his lifetime, only one of Van Gogh's paintings, The Red Vineyard,
                            was sold.

                        <h2>Early years</h2>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in
                            Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands.
                            He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh (1822–1885), a minister of the Dutch
                            Reformed Church, and his wife, Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the
                            name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. His
                            grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), was a prominent art dealer and a theology graduate from
                            the University of Leiden in 1811. This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art
                            dealers, and may have been named after his great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gogh's mother came from a prosperous family in The Hague. His
                            father was the youngest son of a minister. The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia,
                            married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh's parents married in May 1851 and
                            moved to Zundert. His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor,
                            and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and Willemina (known as "Wil"). In later life, Van Gogh
                            remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo. Theodorus's salary as a minister was modest,
                            but the Church also supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a
                            carriage and horse; his mother Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family's
                            high social position.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child. He was taught at
                            home by his mother and a governess, and in 1860, was sent to the village school. In 1864, he
                            was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen, where he felt abandoned, and he campaigned
                            to come home. Instead, in 1866, his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg, where
                            he was also deeply unhappy. His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to
                            draw as a child by his mother, and his early drawings are expressive, but do not approach
                            the intensity of his later work. Constant Cornelis Huijsmans, who had been a successful
                            artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in
                            favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van
                            Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect.
                            In March 1868, he abruptly returned home. He later wrote that his youth was "austere and
                            cold, and sterile".</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1869, Van Gogh's uncle Cent obtained a position for him
                            at the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was
                            transferred to Goupil's London branch on Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87
                            Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work and,
                            at 20, was earning more than his father. Theo's wife, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, later remarked
                            that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's
                            daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but she rejected him after he confessed his feelings; she was
                            secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated and religiously fervent. His
                            father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues
                            such as the degree to which the art dealers commodified art, and he was dismissed a year
                            later.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1876, he returned to England to take unpaid work as a
                            supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to
                            Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement was not successful; he left
                            to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten; in
                            1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht.
                            He was unhappy in the position, and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the
                            Bible into English, French, and German. He immersed himself in Christianity and became
                            increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz,
                            Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support his religious conviction and his desire to become a
                            pastor, in 1877, the family sent him to live with his uncle Johannes Stricker, a respected
                            theologian, in Amsterdam. Van Gogh prepared for the University of Amsterdam theology
                            entrance examination; he failed the exam and left his uncle's house in July 1878. He
                            undertook, but also failed, a three-month course at a Protestant missionary school in Laken,
                            near Brussels.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1879, he took up a post as a missionary at
                            Petit-Wasmes in the working class, coal-mining district of Borinage in Belgium. To show
                            support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery
                            to a homeless person and moved to a small hut, where he slept on straw. His humble living
                            conditions did not endear him to church authorities, who dismissed him for "undermining the
                            dignity of the priesthood". He then walked the 75 kilometres (47 mi) to Brussels, returned
                            briefly to Cuesmes in the Borinage, but he gave in to pressure from his parents to return
                            home to Etten. He stayed there until around March 1880, which caused concern and frustration
                            for his parents. His father was especially frustrated and advised that his son be committed
                            to the lunatic asylum in Geel.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Gogh returned to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged
                            with a miner until October. He became interested in the people and scenes around him, and he
                            recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He
                            travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with
                            the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal
                            schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie
                            in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and
                            perspective.</p>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His artistic career was extremely short, lasting only the 10 years
                    from 1880 to 1890. During the
                    first four years of this period, while acquiring technical proficiency, he confined himself almost
                    entirely to drawings and watercolors. First, he went to study drawing at the Brussels Academy; in
                    1881 he moved to his father’s parsonage at Etten, Netherlands, and began to work from nature.</p>

                    alt="The Potato Eaters" class="bio-image" />
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Gogh worked hard and methodically but soon perceived the
                    difficulty of self-training and the need
                    to seek the guidance of more experienced artists. Late in 1881 he settled at The Hague to work with
                    a Dutch landscape painter, Anton Mauve. He visited museums and met with other painters. Van Gogh
                    thus extended his technical knowledge and experimented with oil paint in the summer of 1882. In 1883
                    the urge to be “alone with nature” and with peasants took him to Drenthe, an isolated part of the
                    northern Netherlands frequented by Mauve and other Dutch artists, where he spent three months before
                    returning home, which was then at Nuenen, another village in the Brabant. He remained at Nuenen
                    during most of 1884 and 1885, and during these years his art grew bolder and more assured. He
                    painted three types of subjects—still life, landscape, and figure—all interrelated by their
                    reference to the daily life of peasants, to the hardships they endured, and to the countryside they
                    cultivated. Émile Zola’s Germinal (1885), a novel about the coal-mining region of France, greatly
                    impressed van Gogh, and sociological criticism is implicit in many of his pictures from this
                    period—e.g., Weavers and The Potato Eaters. Eventually, however, he felt too isolated in Nuenen.</p>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His understanding of the possibilities of painting was evolving
                    rapidly; from studying Hals he
                    learned to portray the freshness of a visual impression, while the works of Paolo Veronese and
                    Eugène Delacroix taught him that color can express something by itself. This led to his enthusiasm
                    for Peter Paul Rubens and inspired his sudden departure for Antwerp, Belgium, where the greatest
                    number of Rubens’s works could be seen. The revelation of Rubens’s mode of direct notation and of
                    his ability to express a mood by a combination of colors proved decisive in the development of van
                    Gogh’s style. Simultaneously, van Gogh discovered Japanese prints and Impressionist painting. All
                    these sources influenced him more than the academic principles taught at the Antwerp Academy, where
                    he was enrolled. His refusal to follow the academy’s dictates led to disputes, and after three
                    months he left precipitately in 1886 to join Theo in Paris. There, still concerned with improving
                    his drawing, van Gogh met Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, and others who were to play
                    historic roles in modern art. They opened his eyes to the latest developments in French painting. At
                    the same time, Theo introduced him to Camille Pissarro, Georges Seurat, and other artists of the
                    Impressionist group.</p>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Largely on the basis of the works of the last three years of his life,
                    van Gogh is generally
                    considered one of the greatest Dutch painters of all time. His work exerted a powerful influence on
                    the development of much modern painting, in particular on the works of the Fauve painters, Chaim
                    Soutine, and the German Expressionists. Yet of the more than 800 oil paintings and 700 drawings that
                    constitute his life’s work, he sold only one in his lifetime. Always desperately poor, he was
                    sustained by his faith in the urgency of what he had to communicate and by the generosity of Theo,
                    who believed in him implicitly. The letters that he wrote to Theo from 1872 onward, and to other
                    friends, give such a vivid account of his aims and beliefs, his hopes and disappointments, and his
                    fluctuating physical and mental state that they form a unique and touching biographical record that
                    is also a great human document.</p>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of van Gogh was virtually unknown when he killed himself:
                    only one article about him had
                    appeared during his lifetime. He had exhibited a few canvases at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris
                    between 1888 and 1890 and in Brussels in 1890; both salons showed small commemorative groups of his
                    work in 1891. One-man shows of his work did not occur until 1892.</p>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Gogh’s fame dates from the early years of the 20th century, and
                    since then his reputation has
                    never ceased to grow. A large part of this reputation is based on the image of van Gogh as a
                    struggling genius, working unappreciated in isolation. The dramatic elements of his life—poverty,
                    self-mutilation, mental breakdown, and suicide—feed the drama of this mythology. The notion that his
                    unorthodox talent was unrecognized and rejected by society heightens the legend, as it is just that
                    sort of isolation and struggle that has come to define the modern concept of the artist. This
                    mythical van Gogh has become almost inseparable from his art, inspiring artists to dramatize his
                    saga in poems, novels, films, operas, dance ensembles, orchestral compositions, and a popular song.
                    Wide and diverse audiences have come to appreciate his art, and the record-breaking attendance at
                    exhibitions of his works—as well as the popularity of commercial items featuring imagery from his
                    oeuvre—reveal that, within the span of a century, van Gogh has become perhaps the most recognized
                    painter of all time. The unprecedented prices his works have attained through auction and the
                    attention paid to forgery scandals have only increased van Gogh’s stature in the public imagination.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the most sensational events of van Gogh’s life—the conflicts
                    with Gauguin, the mutilation of
                    his left ear, and the suicide—are thinly documented and layered with apocrypha and anecdote, there
                    is a trend in van Gogh studies to penetrate the layers of myth by reconstructing the known facts of
                    the artist’s life. This scholarly analysis has taken many forms. Medical and psychological experts
                    have examined contemporary descriptions of his symptoms and their prescribed treatments in an
                    attempt to diagnose van Gogh’s condition (theories suggest epilepsy, schizophrenia, or both). Other
                    scholars have studied evidence of his interaction with colleagues, neighbors, and relatives and have
                    meticulously examined the sites where van Gogh worked and the locales where he lived. In light of
                    van Gogh’s continually increasing popularity, scholars have even deconstructed the mythologizing
                    process itself. These investigations shed greater light on the artist and his art and also offer
                    further proof that, more than a century after his death, van Gogh’s extraordinary appeal continues
                    to endure and expand.</p>
